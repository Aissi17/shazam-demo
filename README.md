# Shazam Demo

This project is about Shazam Demo. How to analyze and index musics to database and search musics in database. I will add "How to use", "How is it working?" etc...

## Installing

First of all, you have to install Python 2.7 version and pip

```
pip install numpy termcolor pyaudio wave pydub
```

## How to use

1. Run reset.py file for clear and initialize your database

```
python reset.py
```

2. Put your mp3 files to mp3 folder
3. Run analyze.py 

```
python analyze.py

4. When you see indexed musics to database and run listen.py and open music for discovering. You have to pass second for listening offset (by default second is 10)

```
python listen.py -s 5
```

5. Done!
